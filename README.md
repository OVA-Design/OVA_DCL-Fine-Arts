# Decentraland Build - Fine Arts Gallery by OVA.Design

### Project Concept

**"Art is a mirror, a reflection of history, and an interpretation of the world." - E. A. Bucchianeri**

**This project aims to curate a collection of the world's most renowned artworks and paintings from throughout history, reimagining them in a new 3D digital format.**

A series of iconic artworks from history were selected  and showcased in a virtual gallery scene. Each artwork have its dedicated display area, consisting of two main components:

**1. 2D Image Display:** An iconic painting presented in high resolution as a 2D image hosted on an external server, complete with appropriate framing.

**2. 3D Interpretation:**  Various 2D to 3D conversion techniques were employed in creating the 3D version of the same painting. These techniques include:

- Extracting unique colors and shapes onto individual layers and stacking them in 3D space to create a parallax effect using image processing tools like Photoshop.
- Generating 3D meshes with depth maps, utilizing AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.
- Sculpting in 3D while referencing the 2D image, using 3D modeling tools like Blender or Maya.
- A combination of the above techniques.

### 3D Assets Reusability:
These digital rendition of renowned artworks transformed into 3D assets are free to be reused in your scene within  These high-quality assets would be of great complement to any (empty) open transitional spaces in galleries, shops or public developments, etc. Each art asset is optimized, lightweight and versatile, suitable for use in various settings. All assets are organized within the images and models folders.
